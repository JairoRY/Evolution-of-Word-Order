# Evolution-of-Word-Order
This project analyzes and contrasts the syntactic word order of Old English and Modern English by processing text from two distinct corpora; it extracts the frequencies of the six possible orderings of Subject (S), Verb (V), and Object (O) to highlight linguistic changes over time.

The analysis is performed by two C++ programs, one for each corpus, which generate statistical data. An R script then consumes this data to produce a series of comparative visualizations.

## Project Components

**`processPCEEC.cpp`**: A C++ program that parses syntactic tree data from the Penn-Cambridge Edition of the Paston Letters (PCEEC), that represent an older form of English. It identifies sentence constituents (subject, verb, object) using regular expressions on phrase labels (e.g., `NP-SBJ`, `VB`, `NP-OB1`) to determine the word order. Its output is `word_order_stats_PCEEC.csv`.

* **`processSusanne.cpp`**: A C++ program that processes files from the Susanne Corpus, which is annotated for syntactic structure and represents Modern English. It tracks clause boundaries and functional roles (`:s` for subject, `:o` for object) to identify constituent order. Its output is `word_order_stats_Susanne.csv`.

* **`graphs.R`**: An R script that reads the `.csv` files generated by the C++ programs. It uses the `ggplot2` library to create a set of comparative plots, including bar charts and pie charts, saving them as PDF files.

* **`Makefile.txt`**: The build script to compile and run the C++ analysis programs.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Corpus Data**: This project requires access to the PCEEC and Susanne corpora. The code expects them to be in the following directory structure:
    * `pceec2-main/data/parsed/` 
    * `SUSANNE/fc2/`

2.  **C++ Compiler**: A C++ compiler that supports the C++20 standard is required (e.g., g++). The Makefile uses `g++` by default.

3.  **Make**: The `make` utility is needed to use the provided Makefile.

4.  **R Environment**: An installation of R is required to run the `graphs.R` script. The following R packages must be installed:
    * `ggplot2`
    * `readr`
    * `dplyr`
    * `tidyr`
    * `scales`

## How to Run

1.  **Place Corpus Data**: Ensure the PCEEC and Susanne corpus files are located in the correct directories as specified above.

2.  **Compile the C++ Programs**: Open a terminal and run the `make` command. This will compile both `processPCEEC.cpp` and `processSusanne.cpp` and create two executables.
    ```sh
    make all
    ```

3.  **Run the Analyses**: Execute the analysis for each corpus using their respective `make` targets.
    ```sh
    # Run the analysis on the PCEEC (Old English) data
    make run_pceec

    # Run the analysis on the Susanne (Modern English) data
    make run_susanne
    ```
    These commands will generate the `word_order_stats_PCEEC.csv` and `word_order_stats_Susanne.csv` files.

4.  **Generate Visualizations**: Run the R script to produce the comparative plots.
    ```sh
    Rscript graphs.R
    ```
    This will generate 3 PDF files in your project directory (`bar_word_order.pdf`, `pie_modern_english.pdf`, `pie_old_english.pdf`).

## Makefile Targets

The `Makefile` provides the following commands:
* `all`: Compiles both C++ source files into executables (`processPCEEC` and `processSusanne`).
* `run_pceec`: Runs the analysis for the PCEEC corpus.
* `run_susanne`: Runs the analysis for the Susanne corpus.
* `clean`: Removes the compiled executables.
